Patrick Monnerat for his contribution, Client-side SSL certificate support

Ryan Dewhurst (http://www.ethicalhack3r.co.uk) for his suggestion to cover all checks (empty array, null cookie) of http://www.owasp.org/index.php/Full_Path_Disclosure
 --data, --param-array, -n/--null-session options.

 
Brendan Coles (http://itsecuritysolutions.org/, http://whatweb.net/) for his suggestion that known web application paths should be bundled for convenience and time saving. I've done files with dozens of open-source web app known paths under 'paths' directory. You can do it for your desired CMS/application by -d and -g options. See EXAMPLES for more details. Submit latest path files to inspathx at yehg.net.


Sebastien.damaye for his write-up about inspathx tutorial

And finally to developers community, their common coding practice, their belief on path disclosure as server side issue 
that make this tool meaningful and usable for current plus future web apps
