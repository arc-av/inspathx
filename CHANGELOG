fixed username extraction

added regexp support (use your own regexp rules to search in returned responses in addition to built-in regexp error messages)

added null session cookie  support
	--null-cookie [will auto null session for all languages ]
	
added custom headers  support
	--headers "cookie: sid[%00]=1\r\nX-pingback:: %00"
