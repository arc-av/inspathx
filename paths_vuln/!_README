This folder lists a list of web applications with known path disclosure vulnerabilities.
As most web application authors assume path disclosure as server level/configuration issue, 
hopefully these disclosure will remain intact for future versions of their applications.

Don't waste your time by reporting these issues to developers.
They will reject your reports. 

Use them as your reference in your pentest projects.
